Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
Our mobile application is designed for small to large bussiness looking to keep track of their inventory. Currently our mobile app works on Android 11 & up. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Some necessary screens our mobile app team needed to develop to ensure our users had a great experience were first off a login screen. Once a user was logged in it was important for them to be able to track current inventory as well as see sold inventory. Our users also wanted the ability to edit, delete, and add an item. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
When coding our app we started with user input on how they felt it should flow. First starting off with a login screen followed by a main menu that would serve as the traffic driver. Then we added functions for users to be able to input inventory as well as see specific criteria. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
The process of testing is crucial in any software development lifecycle to ensure there are no unexpecteds when you start your go to market strategy. I tested frequently and commented often.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Some initially planned UI just was to complex and had to be scratched and replaced with a more simple solution that still provided the same user experience. I turned to other on market apps to get some ideas to redesign and implement.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
My login screen and ability to redirect buttons is where I found myself most successful. I semi understood how to write lines that would create tables based on user input as well as retrieve items from a user database.
